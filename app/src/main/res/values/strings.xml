    <string name="about_uae">
        The UAE is a federation of seven Emirates located in the Middle East. The country has emerged as both a dynamic international business centre
        and a laid-back tourist escape. From unspoiled beaches to rugged mountains, and picturesque heritage sites to ultra-modern shopping malls, the
        UAE offers a truly unique lifestyle experience.\n\n
        As the gateway between east and west, the UAE has become a safe and accessible base for leading multinationals from across the globe to establish a
        foothold in the Middle East market, and to explore emerging economies further afield. This expanding business base attracts students and professionals
        from around the world, giving the UAE a unique multicultural identity, where nationals from more than 200 countries live in harmony with the Emirati people.\n\n
         The higher educational landscape in the UAE reflects the cultural mix of the country. With a thirst for innovation, the UAE is also gathering a growing reputation
        for its advancements in research and technological development.\n\n
        One of the fastest growing cities in the world, Dubai is the place where the sophistication of the 21st century meets the unique charm of an ancient trading port.
        With world-class infrastructure and facilities, the city combines the cosmopolitan lifestyle of the western world with eastern traditions and hospitality.\n\n
         Already renowned for its bold ambition, as the home of the world’s tallest building and the world’s largest man-made island, Dubai will continue to grow its
        international stature when it hosts the World Expo in 2020.\n
